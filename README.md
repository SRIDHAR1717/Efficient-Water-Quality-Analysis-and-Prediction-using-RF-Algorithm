Efficient Water Quality Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a Random Forest Regression model to analyse key water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, conductivity, BOD, nitrate content, and coliform levels to predict the Water Quality Index (WQI). The system includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.

The trained model is deployed using a Flask web application that allows users to input water quality parameters and obtain real-time WQI predictions through a user-friendly interface. The project aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective, and automated solution for water quality monitoring and environmental management.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Flask, HTML, CSS
